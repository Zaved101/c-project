 This chapter describes how to install the Hospital Management System (BBMS) on mobile phone and computer/laptop. It contains the following topics:  
•	Requirements for Installing the HMS on Windows  
•	Requirements for Installing the HMS on android
•	Requirements for Installing the HMS on UNIX

Requirements for Installing the HMS on Windows 

The installation prerequisites for installing on Windows are as follows:  
•	The target machine must be clean, that is, not running any other WebLogic applications, including any previous version of the HMS.  
•	BEA WebLogic 8.1.0 must be installed and configured. This guide assumes that the WebLogic root directory is: D:\bea\weblogic81.  


Requirements for Installing the BBMS on Android  

Android supports a variety of features your app can leverage through platform APIs. Some features are hardware-based (such as a compass sensor), some are software-based (such as app widgets), and some are dependent on the platform version. Not every device supports every feature, so you may need to control your app's availability to devices based on your app's required features.
To achieve the largest user-base possible for your app, you should strive to support as many device configurations as possible using a single APK. In most situations, you can do so by disabling optional features at runtime and providing app resources with alternatives for different configurations (such as different layouts for different screen sizes). If necessary, however, you can restrict your app's availability to devices through Google Play Store based on the following device characteristics:
•	Device features 
•	Platform version 
•	Screen configuration 

Requirements for Installing the Banking Application on UNIX  

The installation prerequisites for installing on UNIX are as follows:  
•	The target machine must be clean, that is, not running any other WebLogic applications, including any previous version of the BBMS.  
 
•	BEA WebLogic 8.1.0 must be installed and configured. This guide assumes that the WebLogic root directory is: /bea/weblogic81.
